# process-code-coverage-summary

This action works in conjunction with [im-open/code-coverage-report-generator].  If a `Summary.md` file is created in the report generator action by including `MarkdownSummary` in the `reporttypes` input, this action will take the contents of that file and create a Status Check or PR Comment depending on the flags set.  This action does not create code coverage reports and it only processes one summary report at a time.

## Thresholds

The status check can be seen as a new item on the workflow run, a PR comment or on the PR Status Check section. If thresholds for line or branch coverage have been provided and the actual branch or line coverage does not meet or exceed the threshold, the status check will be marked as `failed`.  Having the status check marked as `failed` will prevent PRs from being merged.  If this status check behavior is not desired, the `ignore-threshold-failures` input can be set and the outcome will be marked as `neutral` if threshold failures are detected.  The status badge that is shown in the comment or status check body will still indicate it was a failure though.

If you want the code coverage to be reported without indicating whether it was a success or failure, leave the `line-threshold` and `branch-threshold` inputs as their default 0.

## Limitations 

GitHub does have a size limitation of 65535 characters for a Status Check body or a PR Comment.  This action will fail if the contents of the summary file exceed the GitHub [limit].

If you have multiple workflows triggered by the same `pull_request` or `push` event, GitHub creates one checksuite for that commit.  The checksuite gets assigned to one of the workflows randomly and all status checks for that commit are reported to that checksuite. That means if there are multiple workflows with the same trigger, your status checks may show on a different workflow run than the run that created them.

## Contributing

When creating new PRs please ensure:
1. The action has been recompiled.  See the [Recompiling](#recompiling) section below for more details.
2. For major or minor changes, at least one of the commit messages contains the appropriate `+semver:` keywords listed under [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
3. The `README.md` example has been updated with the new version.  See [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
4. The action code does not contain sensitive information.

### Recompiling

If changes are made to the action's code in this repository, or its dependencies, you will need to re-compile the action.

```sh
# Installs dependencies and bundles the code
npm run build

# Bundle the code (if dependencies are already installed)
npm run bundle
```

These commands utilize [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#bundling-for-node) to bundle the action and
its dependencies into a single file located in the `dist` folder.

### Incrementing the Version

This action uses [git-version-lite] to examine commit messages to determine whether to perform a major, minor or patch increment on merge.  The following table provides the fragment that should be included in a commit message to active different increment strategies.
| Increment Type | Commit Message Fragment                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| major          | +semver:breaking                            |
| major          | +semver:major                               |
| minor          | +semver:feature                             |
| minor          | +semver:minor                               |
| patch          | *default increment type, no comment needed* |
